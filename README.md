# FlowersShopHibernate

## Motivation
This is a project I did for my Java programming course at IT School which involved using my basic knowledge of Java, MySQL and the Hidernate ORM.

## Description

My project is a simple application for managing products, clients, and orders. It provides basic features, including adding products, managing clients, and placing orders.
For ease of use, the program automatically generates customers, orders and products using the Java Faker dependency. I also used the Scanner class to enter manually, from the keyboard, the number of customers and products to be generated automatically.


## Key Features
- C.R.U.D. operations on customers, orders and products.
- Adding, viewing, and updating products.
- Managing clients and searching for them by name.
- Placing orders.

## Usage
- Open the application and choose one of the available options in the main menu.
- Follow the instructions from the IDE's console to add, view, or update data.
- To exit, select the "Exit" option from the main menu.


## Requirements:
- Java 20: https://www.oracle.com/ro/java/technologies/downloads/;
- XAMPP (or other Apache HTTP Server and MySQL database manager): https://www.apachefriends.org/.
